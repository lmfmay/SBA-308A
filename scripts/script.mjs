// Organize your JavaScript code into at least three (3) different module files, and import functions and data across files as necessary.
// Ensure the program runs as expected, without any undesired behavior caused by misunderstanding of the JavaScript event loop (such as race conditions, API calls being handled out of order, etc.).
// Create an engaging user experience through the use of HTML and CSS.
// Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).
// Commit frequently to the git repository.
// Include a README file that contains a description of your application.
// Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience
